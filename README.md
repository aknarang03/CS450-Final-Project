# CS450-Final-Project

using USB Rubber Ducky to DNS spoof
NOTE: Any files renamed from inject.bin to [something] inject.bin need to be renamed back to inject.bin before being used in the USB. Otherwise, it will not work. 

"Disable google" was initial test for using USB rubber ducky to alter the hosts file.

"Monmouth to httpforever" is sample of redirecting monmouth.edu to some http site; baseline for our project.
